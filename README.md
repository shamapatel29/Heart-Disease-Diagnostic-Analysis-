# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis-
# INTRODUCTIOON
Diagnostic investigation in cardiology are methods of identifying heart conditions associated with unhealthy,pathologic, heart function.Cardiovascular disease(CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally,taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year.Diagnostic cardiology is used to evaluate the health of the heart.
# OBJECTIVE 
The goal of this project is to analyse the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the heart disease.To enhance the diagnostic process of heart disease using advanced data analysis techniques.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status.You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation.The database extracts various information such as Heart disease rates,Heart disease by gender, by age.
#  ABOUT DATASET
The Dataset Contains 1025 Rows and 14 Columns.
age: The person's age in years sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female) cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina,Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic) trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital) chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false) restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria) thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 =no) oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat,Value 3: down sloping) ca: The number of major vessels (0-3) thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 =normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7=reversable defect) num: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
